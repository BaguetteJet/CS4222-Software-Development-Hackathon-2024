# Hackathon Problem Statements

Choose any one from the given list A-E and submit your choice here.    

A. Create a 2D array for this image.

a. Increase the size of the image by 1.5X

b. Crop the highlighted part

Hint: Not necessary to have the accurate cropped part. Can have some approximations.

c. Change all pixel values of the image to black.

d. Plot the pixel distributions of the original image and the black image.

e. Plot a chart showing the time complexity of each of the operations.
